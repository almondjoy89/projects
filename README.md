Peer Evaluation:
When running your code it worked when I took the camera code out because the camera code is supposed to error. The tea selection part works perfect. I can't tell if the camera part works because of the Titanium program won't let it run but the code looks good. I can't tell if the navigation works because of the camera errror but from the code it seems like it should work fine.
